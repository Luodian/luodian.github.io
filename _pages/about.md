#### About Me

I am a final-year PhD student and luckily advised by [Prof. Ziwei Liu](https://liuziwei7.github.io/). My research focuses on multimodal models and building true intelligence.

[Feeling the AGI](https://x.com/ilyasut/status/1578238338288402432) and seeing the progress give me a deep passion for what I am doing, driving a commitment not bound by material gain, but by the quiet call of inner beliefs and a true sense of purpose.

My another motivation is to work with brilliant researchers. To this end, I co-founded the research-oriented organization [LMMs-Lab](https://huggingface.co/lmms-lab) with Prof. Ziwei Liu. We provide compute resources and ideas to collaborate with researchers who share the same vision and understanding of building intelligence. Within LMMs-Lab, I have mentored junior students to deliver successful projects such as [LMMs-Engine](https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/lmms-engine), [LLaVA-OneVision-1.5](https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/LLaVA-OneVision-1.5), [Octopus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08588), [VideoMMMU](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13826), [Multimodal-SAE](https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/multimodal-sae).

You can email me if you have ideas or thoughts on research or the future form of life. I am busy but always willing to talk and help.
