#### About Me

I am a third-year PhD student and luckily advised by [Prof. Ziwei Liu](https://liuziwei7.github.io/). My research focuses on multimodal models and building true intelligence.

[Feeling the AGI](https://x.com/ilyasut/status/1578238338288402432) and seeing the progress give me a deep passion for what I am doing, driving a commitment not bound by material gain, but by the quiet call of inner beliefs and a true sense of purpose.

I am lucky to work with many brilliant researchers in a non-profit research-oriented organization, [LMMs-Lab](https://huggingface.co/lmms-lab), we share the sincere passion for developing multimodal intelligence.
