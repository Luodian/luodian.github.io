#### About

I am a first-year PhD student and luckily advised by the brilliant and kind researcher [Prof. Ziwei Liu](https://liuziwei7.github.io/). With his guidance, I am passionate about deep learning research in the following topics:

(1) [Pathways system and PaLM](https://ai.googleblog.com/2022/04/pathways-language-model-palm-scaling-to.html): a next-generation AI model that can multi-task across domains and modalities.

(2) [Embodied AI](https://embodied-ai.org/): an autonomous agent that learns to solve challenging tasks within environment through interaction and exploration.

These are moonshot wild dreams and also what I will focus on in the long run. 

Currently I base my first step research topics on [computer-vision-in-the-wild](https://github.com/Computer-Vision-in-the-Wild/CVinW_Readings) and emerging abilities in large vision language models (e.g. Chain of Thought, Multi-step Reasoning).

If you are an undergraduate & master student and want to dive in these topics, feel free to drop an email~
