#### About

I am a second-year PhD student and luckily advised by [Prof. Ziwei Liu](https://liuziwei7.github.io/). Currently I base my research topics on [large-scale multi-mdoality models](https://github.com/Luodian/Otter) and emerging abilities in foundation models.

I am always grateful to those more senior who have a deep understanding of these topics for their advice. Besides, I am always willing to collaborate with people who are also interested in relevant issues, and provide corresponding guidance to younger students (undergrad or master).
<!-- If you are an undergraduate & master student and want to dive in these topics, I am willing to provide academic guidance and research collaboration. -->
