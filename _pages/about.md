#### About

I am a first-year PhD student and luckily advised by the brilliant and kind researcher [Prof. Ziwei Liu](https://liuziwei7.github.io/).

There are two reasons why I am involved in deep learning research:

(1) I believe there will certainly be (and I would like to contribute to) the next-generation AI model that can multi-task across domains and modalities. Inspired by [PaLM](https://ai.googleblog.com/2022/04/pathways-language-model-palm-scaling-to.html).

(2) I think AI (not only RL) should be online and interactive, e.g. an autonomous agent that learns through interaction and exploration, then to creatively solve challenging tasks within environment. Inspired by [Embodied AI](https://embodied-ai.org/).

These are moonshot wild dreams, and that's what I've been focusing on in the long run. Currently I base my first step research topics on [computer-vision-in-the-wild](https://github.com/Computer-Vision-in-the-Wild/CVinW_Readings) and emerging abilities in large vision language models.

If you are an undergraduate & master student and want to dive in these topics, feel free to drop an email~
