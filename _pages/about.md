#### About

I am a first-year PhD student and luckily advised by the brilliant and kind researcher [Prof. Ziwei Liu](https://liuziwei7.github.io/). With his guidance, I am passionate about deep learning research in the following topics:

(1) [Foundation Models](https://crfm.stanford.edu/commentary/2021/10/18/steinhardt.html): Stable Diffusion, GPT, they are seemingly promising to put AI with *real* intelligence into pratical use.

(2) [Embodied AI](https://embodied-ai.org/): an autonomous agent that learns to solve challenging tasks within environment through interaction and exploration.

These are moonshot wild dreams and also what I will focus on in the long run. 

Currently I base my first step research topics on [computer-vision-in-the-wild](https://github.com/Computer-Vision-in-the-Wild/CVinW_Readings) and emerging abilities in foundation models.

I am always grateful to those more senior who have a deep understanding of these topics for their advice. Besides, I am always willing to collaborate with people who are also interested in relevant issues, and provide corresponding guidance to younger students (undergrad or master).
<!-- If you are an undergraduate & master student and want to dive in these topics, I am willing to provide academic guidance and research collaboration. -->
